# Jester Selector Alpha

This will eventually be old and replaced by a beautiful react app, but for now How to Use.

# How to Use:
- Have everyone join by going to https://jester-selector-alpha.herokuapp.com/
- Have them enter their name and select the role the game gave them
- When everyone is in, have the host press Ready
- Enjoy your new roles! If the Jester is voted out then end the game by having the imposters call an emergency
- After playing, refresh and continue using the same steps.
